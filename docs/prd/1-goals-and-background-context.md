# 1. Goals and Background Context

## 1.1 Goals

- **G1:** Deploy a complete 3-tier application (Frontend + API + DB) to Kubernetes from scratch
- **G2:** Implement production-grade observability with metrics (Prometheus/Grafana) and centralized logging (Loki)
- **G3:** Automate infrastructure provisioning with Terraform (Azure resources, remote state, modules)
- **G4:** Build a complete CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions covering build, test, push, and deployment stages
- **G5:** Package and manage applications using Helm charts (custom + community)
- **G6:** Configure Kubernetes networking (Services, Ingress, TLS) following production best practices
- **G7:** Implement secrets management progressively (K8s Secrets → Azure Key Vault)
- **G8:** Gain hands-on experience with Azure cloud provider (ACR, Key Vault, bonus AKS)
- **G9:** Build a portfolio-ready project demonstrating full DevOps chain mastery as foundation for MLOps transition

## 1.2 Background Context

This project addresses a specific skills gap: transitioning from a fullstack-heavy background with limited DevOps exposure to a production-ready DevOps skillset, ultimately preparing for MLOps/GenAI roles.

The participant has 3 years of professional experience but predominantly in fullstack development, with only one deployment participation and 2 years without active DevOps practice. The current knowledge state shows theoretical understanding (level B) for deployment but significant gaps (level C) in monitoring, infrastructure automation, CI/CD deployment stages, and production best practices.

The chosen approach—"Full Chain Progressive"—builds skills layer by layer over 7 days, with each day delivering a concrete, deployable increment. The stack is intentionally MLOps-ready: Python API (FastAPI pathway), metrics-first observability (critical for ML model monitoring), and cloud-native patterns (containers, orchestration, IaC).
