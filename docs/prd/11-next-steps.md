# 11. Next Steps

## For UX Expert
> N/A - This project does not require UX design. Frontend is a minimal demo component.

## For Architect

```
@Architect - Please review the PRD at docs/prd.md and create the technical architecture document.

Context:
- DevOps learning project (1 week + buffer)
- 3-tier app: React/Next.js + Python FastAPI + PostgreSQL
- Infrastructure: Kind (local), Azure (ACR, Key Vault, bonus AKS)
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
- IaC: Terraform with remote state
- Packaging: Helm + Helmfile
- Observability: Prometheus, Grafana, Loki

Focus areas:
1. Component diagram with all services and interactions
2. Network topology (local Kind and Azure AKS)
3. CI/CD pipeline architecture (build → test → push → deploy flow)
4. Security architecture (secrets flow, TLS termination points)
5. Folder structure refinements if needed
6. Technical risks and mitigation strategies

Constraints:
- Azure Free Tier + $200 credits
- Must work on local Kind cluster first
- Production patterns even for learning project
```
